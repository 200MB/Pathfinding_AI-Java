V1 ()

The AI is simple and almost always finds a shortest way to a finish line as long as it has no intersections.

V1.5 (CURRENT)

Compared to V1 this one is way smarter. V1 could only navigate through free space and there were some exceptions for actually designed "walled off"
mazes. now V1.5 can navigate itself through any type of maze. this version is also using threads and can find multiple (if its possible) ways to the finish line.
